Just try'n to follow this series in the hopes to learn something about JS and HTML5.
I don't think I'll be using this framework for the eventual diceroller (still want to use babylon for that), BUT it
could be usefull for the canvas.

note to self: this might actually not be that bad, netcode is simple emit/receive structure, with ability to send custom data.
Might be all I need to get that diceroller thing going, or even better.. create a "mapwalker" thing
